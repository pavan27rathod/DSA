Problems solved according to respective techniques:

1. Two Pointers:
    1. Sort 0 & 1 in array -> Running from both ends of an array
    2. Move all negative elements to one side of array -> Slow pointer, i iterating through array & j moving slowly if arr[i]<0


2. Modulus Method:
    1. Rotate array by k steps
